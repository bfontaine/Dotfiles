# Dotfiles

Here are some of my dotfiles.

## Vim

[`vim.sh`][vimsh] is a post-install script for Vim. It installs 40+ plugins,
syntax files and omnicomplete scripts. More importantly, itâ€™s indempotent:
running it once or ten times has the same outcome: all missing plugins are
installed the first time.
